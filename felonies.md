## Low-level felonies most filed, and convicted

A separate [data set](https://performance.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Number-Of-Felony-Cases-Filed-By-Felony-Class/kcfs-dufb), from the Circuit Court of Cook County, shows that 173,204 felony cases were filed between 2005 and 2009. The majority of these were the lowest-level felonies - class 4. 

The data requested by the Chicago Justice Project shows that, during the same time period, 145,487 cases that were filed as felonies resulted in a conviction, with 144,835 of those cases resulting in a felony conviction. This number is smaller than the number of cases filed not only because some cases did not result in a conviction but because the data reflecting cases that resulted in a conviction may not contain records for cases that were filed in 2005-2009 but had not been completed when the data was requested. 

In addition, plea bargain cases in Cook County Court have a significant effect on the final convictions. Some of the cases in the data were filed with charges for high-level felonies and later amended to lower-level felonies or misdemeanors.
