<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>One of the key challenges in analyzing our data was understanding the records in our spreadsheet and learning how they related to other important but unrepresented parts of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Below we've spelled out the difficulties we encountered, and how dealt with them.</p>

<p>TODO: Add in details to these sections in auto-collapsing sections.</p>

<h4>We don't know if we received every conviction.</h4>

<h4>We don't know how many cases were dismissed or resulted in an acquittal</h4>

<h4>We don't know an individual's initial charge</h4>

<h4>An entry in the dataset wasn't necessarily a conviction handed down by a jury of their peers</h4>

<h4>Crime values were not entered consistently</h4>

<h4>Frequent misspellings and inconsistent abbreviations</h4>


<h3>Data processing</h3>

<p>In order to analyze the data and make it available for public access, the project team had to load the raw data, which was provided in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">comma-separated values</a> (CSV) format, into a database.  We also had to perform multiple transforms on the data in order to make it easier to query the data for our analysis.  The data loading and transformations are performed by a series of Python scripts.  You can view the source code repository for the scripts <a href="https://github.com/sc3/cook-convictions-data">here</a>.</p>

<p>TODO: Add link to lengthy section on data processing.</p>
