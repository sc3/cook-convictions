For this project, we are only looking at one part of the criminal justice system - convictions. But before the court convicts an individual, they must come in conflict with the law, be charged, and usually appear in front of a judge. 

The path of a crime begins with a victimization. From there, if it's recorded, it becomes an incident report, and then may eventually lead to an arrest. Following an arrest is the prosecution, during which time a suspect may await their day in court in Cook County Jail. In court, a judge will eventually decide whether an individual is guilty or innocent. If the judge decides on a guilty verdict, he will convict the individual. 

This data analyzes conviction records in Cook County.
