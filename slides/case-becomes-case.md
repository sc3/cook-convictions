## How a case becomes a case

We did this project because we want you -- the Chicago resident waiting for the train, the suburban commuter, the policymaker, the harried journalist -- to know what occurs in courtrooms in Cook County every day.

For this project, we are only looking at one part of the criminal justice system - convictions. But before the court convicts an individual, they must come in conflict  with the law, be charged, and usually appear in front of a judge.
