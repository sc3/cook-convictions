Though there are offense disparities in many areas, we decided to focus on one of the most controversial - drug convictions. From disparities in crack cocaine to low-level marijuana arrests, looking at the data about drug disparities has been an important source for understanding the criminal justice system. 

When an individual is arrested on a drug charge, they can be booked for manufacturing and delivery, or for possession. Whether it is one or the other depends on many factors - the patrolling officer, whether a person has any priors, or even whether they're able to make a deal with the prosecutor.

Convictions can vary by amounts, but what really matters is the class of a felony or misdemeanor. Many things can impact the class of a conviction - from how the product is packaged to what an individual said during an arrest.  

In this graphic, we divided drug charges by their <span data-term="drugclass">class</span>. The majority of possession charges were class 4 felonies, meaning the majority of people were convicted for the lowest level felony.
