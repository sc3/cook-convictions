By far the largest category of convictions are drug convictions.  When an individual is arrested on a drug charge, they can be booked for manufacturing and delivery, or for possession. Whether it is one or the other depends on many factors - the patrolling officer, whether a person has any priors, or even whether they're able to make a deal with the prosecutor.
