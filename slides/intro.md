Each year, tens of thousands of people stand in front of judges at the [Cook County Circuit Court](http://www.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org),  the largest unified court system in the country. Their offenses range from low-level marijuana charges to multiple murders that put people behind bars for life.

Rare glimpses of what happens behind the courtroom doors trickle out through media reports and the few sensational cases that make headlines.

But getting any more information is difficult. According to the [8 Principles of Open Data](http://opengovdata.org), a measure developed by open government advocates to create a set of universal data principles, Cook County courts, and the [Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court](http://www.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org) who maintain the court's data, makes it only minimally available online and only meets half of the requirements.

Instead, a Cook County resident looking for bulk data about the courts meets a months-long request process that moves through multiple government agencies, and with the possibility of a large filing fee.

This project analyzes five years worth of conviction data received through the [Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County](http://www.cookcountycourt.org/ABOUTTHECOURT/OfficeoftheChiefJudge.aspx) by the [Chicago Justice Project](http://chicagojustice.org). The goal is to shed a light on criminal convictions in Cook County. 

While we would have liked to see all convictions from 2005-2009, we aren't sure if we recieved them all. Our data also didn't include the initial charge, how many cases go through Cook County courtrooms, or if an individual had prior convictions that impacted the court's ruling on their case. 

What we did find through our analysis was that 18-24 year olds have more convictions than any other age group, possession convictions far outpace those for manufacturing and delivering drugs, and convictions for sexual and domestic violence are only a small proportion of total convictions.
