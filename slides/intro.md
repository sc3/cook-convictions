This project is an analysis of five years of Cook County conviction data. The information was received by Tracy Siska of the [Chicago Justice Project](http://chicagojustice.org) from the [Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County](http://www.cookcountycourt.org/ABOUTTHECOURT/OfficeoftheChiefJudge.aspx) through a request to the chief judge. We've posted a copy of that request [here](http://chicagojustice.org/foi/active-foias/cook-county-court-criminal-conviction-data-5-year-extract). 

Each year, tens of thousands of people stand in front of judges at the [Cook County Circuit Court](http://www.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org), the largest unified court system in the country. Their offenses range from marijuana possession charges that result in low-level misdemeanor convictions to multiple murders that put people behind bars for life.

When a violent crime is picked up by the news media, it's often sensationalised so that every minor detail is brought into the public purview. Meanwhile, the vast majority of convictions - mostly drug related - are given little notice. 

This project will attempt to answer several question regarding convictions in Cook County. Upon first receiving the data, it became apparent that the data was messy and incomplete. 

While we would have liked to see all convictions from 2005-2009, we aren't sure if we recieved them all because we don't have information on the total number of cases in the court system with which to compare the data. Our data didn't include the initial charge or if an individual had prior convictions that impacted the court's ruling on their case. Our original request asked for data on race and was not provided. While the Chicago Justice Project's request only asked for information on adults, several entries found in the data included minors. 

The team at [FreeGeek Chicago](http://freegeekchicago.org) helped us clean the data, visualize it, and try to answer the questions we posed when we first obtained the data.
