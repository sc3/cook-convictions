Each year, tens of thousands of people stand in front of judges at the [Cook County Circuit Court](http://www.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org),  the largest unified court system in the country. Their offenses range from low-level marijuana charges to multiple murders that put people behind bars for life.

Rare glimpses of what happens behind the courtroom doors trickle out through media reports and the few sensational cases that make headlines.

It is [relatively easy to get information](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/) on incidents of crime in the city of Chicago. The police department has [releaed crime incident data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) for every incident since 2001. However, an incident of crime is just the [beginning of the criminal justice process](http://crime-punishment.smartchicagoapps.org/). Once an individual is arrested, they begin to go through the court system where it is not simple to gain information about cases. 

Unlike crime incident data, there is no bulk data available on a portal for people to understand who is being convicted and for what. There's no win/loss record posted for the State's Attorney's office. There's not a simple way to watch a case move through the system or to get a sense of what the most common convictions are. The Smart Chicago Collaborative, together with the Chicago Justice Project and FreeGeek Chicago, has built this site as a way to help residents of Cook County understand convictions in Cook County. 

This project analyzes five years worth of conviction data received through the [Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County](http://www.cookcountycourt.org/ABOUTTHECOURT/OfficeoftheChiefJudge.aspx) by the [Chicago Justice Project](http://chicagojustice.org). You can find a copy of that FOIA request here. 

The data we received was messy and incomplete. Our data didn't include the initial charge, how many cases go through Cook County courtrooms, or if an individual had prior convictions that impacted the court's ruling on their case. The data also didn't include any information on race and the data appeared to include some minors. (The Chicago Justice Project asked for race and had only asked for convictions of adults.) 

FreeGeekChicago helped us to clean up the data and to visualize it. We have included notes throughout the site in which we've excluded or modified data as part of this process. 

What we did find through our analysis was that 18-24 year olds have more convictions than any other age group, possession convictions far outpace those for manufacturing and delivering drugs, and convictions for sexual and domestic violence are only a small proportion of total convictions.
