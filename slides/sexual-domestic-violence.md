When we started the project, we wanted to gain insight more about convictions for crimes against women. However, less than 1 percent of all convictions in Cook County from 2005-2009 were for sexual assault and domestic violence. This includes crimes such as domestic battery, stalking or violating an order of protection. 

The data shows less than 1 percent of all sexual assault and domestic violence convictions in Cook County from 2005-2009. This includes crimes such as domestic battery, stalking or violating an order of protection. 

Though the data does not indicate any details about the people victimized by these crimes, we know they are heavily underreported. The National Crime Victimization Survey estimates that only 28 per cent of sexual assaults and 55 per cent of domestic violence is reported. 

One of the few things we were able to discern from the data is that men are convicted of domestic violence at a far greater rate than women. 

We also know from [other research](https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders) that the vast majority of offenders have a relationship with the survivor to some degree. While stranger attacks may receive the majority of reporting in local news, they are a statistically small part of sexual and domestic violence. Because our data does not address victimization, it is difficult to place a figure on who is affected by these crimes, and their relationship to the accused. 

The number of domestic and sexual violence convictions were too low (649 convictions out of 141,161) to perform any reliable analysis. When we attempted to show these convictions geographically, the variance was too low to be meaningful. Further research will be required to answer questions around domestic violence convictions.
