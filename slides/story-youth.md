## Youth carry overwhelming number of convictions in Cook County	

Street crime skews young. 

It isn't entirely clear why this is the case, but criminologists theorize that most people simply age out of crime. Following cut-off age - 24 - most people committ less crime and often stop altogther by 35. Individual's desire to have a family and whether they have access to legitimate employment impacts the likelihood they will committ a crime. 

<p class="lead"> Cook County hands down more convictions to young people between the ages of 18-24 than it does to all other age groups combined. </p>
