## Youth carry overwhelming number of convictions in Cook County	

Street crime skews young. 

It isn't entirely clear why this is the case, but criminologists theorize that most people simply age out of crime. Following cut-off age - 24 - most people commit less crime and often stop altogether by 35. Individual's desire to have a family and whether they have access to legitimate employment impacts the likelihood they will commit a crime. 

[According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/youth.nr0.htm) the youth unemployment rate overall was 14.3 percent in July 2014; the jobless rate for black youth was the highest of all demographics, at 24.8 percent. 

<p class="lead"> Cook County hands down more convictions to young people between the ages of 18-24 than it does to all other age groups combined. </p>
