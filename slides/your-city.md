We've mapped how convictions are spread around the city and suburbs in Cook County. For the city, we have divided the map into individual community areas. For suburban areas, the map groups areas by their municipality.

Community areas in the City of Chicago with the highest conviction rates, have more convictions per capita than any suburb of Cook County.  However, there are some suburbs with relatively high rates of per capita convictions.  

The data shows higher amounts of convictions in areas with fewer economic resources. The convictions data alone doesn't provide an explanation for this trend. However, other studies have consistently shown this correlation.
