Street crime skews young. 

It isn't entirely clear why this is the case, but [criminologists theorize](http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/60294_Chapter_23.pdf) that most people simply age out of crime. Following cut-off age - 24 - most people commit less crime and often stop altogether by 35. Individual's desire to have a family and whether they have access to legitimate employment impacts the likelihood they will commit a crime. Nationally, the youth unemployment rate in July of 2014 was 14.3 percent. For African-American youth, youth unemployment [spikes to 23.8 percent](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/youth.nr0.htm). The areas that have the most convictions also have [high populations of young African-American youth](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US60621-60621/). As a reminder, the data does not indicate the race of the convicted individual.
 
What the data does indicate is that Cook County has convicted more young people between the ages of 18-24 than all other age groups combined. 

Our conviction data shows that the vast majority of violence convictions are also young people.
