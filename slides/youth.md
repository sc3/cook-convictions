Street crime skews young. 

It isn't entirely clear why this is the case, but [criminologists theorize](http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/60294_Chapter_23.pdf) that most people simply age out of crime. Following the [Bureau of Labor Statistics cut-off age](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/youth.pdf) for youth - 24 - most people commit less crime and often stop altogether by 35. An individual's desire to have a family and whether they have access to legitimate employment impacts the likelihood they will commit a crime. The national youth unemployment rate in July of 2014 was 14.3 percent. For African-American youth, unemployment [spikes to 23.8 percent](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/youth.nr0.htm). The areas that have the most convictions also have [high populations of African-American under the age of 24](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US60621-60621/). As a reminder, the data does not indicate the race of the convicted individual.
 
What the data does indicate is that from 2005 to 2009, Cook County convicted nearly twice as many young people between the ages of 18 and 24 as the next most convicted age group.

Young people also account for the largest numbers of convictions for certain categories of offenses.  Our data shows that the vast majority of convictions for violent index offenses are of young people.
